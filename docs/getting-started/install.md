title: Install Intro.js
---

In this page you can find different ways to obtain an Introjs version and install it.

## Requirements

Intro.js doesn’t have any dependencies and you don’t need to install anything else. Follow the instruction in next steps to download and install Intro.js.

## Download

Now that you’ve got everything installed, let’s get to work!

You can obtain your local copy of Intro.js from:

### CDN

Download it from CDN:

*   [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/intro.js)
*   [JSDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/intro.js)
*   [BootCDN](http://www.bootcdn.cn/intro.js/)


### NPM

Using `npm`:

    npm install intro.js --save
    
### Yarn

Using `yarn`:

    yarn add intro.js
    
### Git

Download the source from git repository, using git clone [Git repo](https://github.com/usablica/intro.js.git)

_We don’t recommend to download the source from the Git because it might have some unstable changes._

## Setup

After download the source, you need to add it to the page. Introjs has two main parts, the css and js files.

You need to add the `JS` file (`intro.js`) before closing the body tag (`</body>`) and adding the CSS file (`introjs.css`) to the header (`<head>`).

That’s it! Now follow next steps or go to [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/start) page.

## RTL

You can use Introjs for RTL websites as well (e.g. Farsi). What you need to do is adding `introjs-rtl.css` file after the main CSS file (`introjs.css`)
